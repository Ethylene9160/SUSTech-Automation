# SDM364 Multi-variable Control and Applications

Some of the predecessors created some repos to store the learning process of this course, and here they provide some links.

## Introduction
This course will introduce the students to the fundamental concepts and methods in modern control theory. Topics include **state-space modelling** of dynamical systems, analysis of LTI state-space systems, stabilizing **controller design**, **observer design**, and **elementary optimal control**.

## Project

### 2023 Fall

This year, the professor provided 2 project. One is about ways to calculate matrix exponential, and another one is about rewriting the `place` function in matlab.

#### Project1 - matrix exp
Study the following paper:
[S. Moler and C. Van Loan, "Nineteen Dubious ways to compute the exponential of a matrix, 25 years later", SIAM Review, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2003.](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/ReadingSeminar/Papers/Moler03.pdf) 
and answer the following questions:
1. If we are interested in computing exp(At) as a function of time t, which of the 19 methods can be used?
2. Can you come up with the 20th method? ðŸ˜­


#### Project2 - advanced place
Modify MATLAB command `place` to give the user more flexibility in choosing pole-placement controller K when it is not unique.
