# EE368 Robotic Motion and Control

[English](./EE368.md) | [简体中文](./EE368_cn.md)

## Introduction

A highly comprehensive course on robotics motion and control:
- The assessment methods are also highly comprehensive: assignments, labs, projects, quizzes, midterm, final exam, and possible attendance (probably not graded).
- Labs are based on the Kinova Gen3 Lite robotic arm and ROS1.

**Outline**
1. Introduction & basic concepts
2. Spacial description and transformation: kinematics & inverse kinematics
3. Jacobians: Singularities & workspace
4. Dynamics: 
    - Lagrangian dynamics formulation
    - Different representation of dynamics formula
5. Linear and feedback control: linear 2nd order system
6. Nonlinear and Adaptive Control:
    - Computed torque method
    - Lyapunov stability
    - Adaptive control
