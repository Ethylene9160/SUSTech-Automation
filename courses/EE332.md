# EE332 Digital System Design

## Introduction

Digital system design with FPGAs using VHDL.

For the difference between VHDL and Verilog, refer to [Hardware Description Languages: VHDL vs Verilog, and Their Functional Uses](https://resources.pcb.cadence.com/blog/2020-hardware-description-languages-vhdl-vs-verilog-and-their-functional-uses) by Cadence.
