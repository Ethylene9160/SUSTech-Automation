# EE346 Mobile Robot Navigation and Control

## Introduction

> Learning the basics of autonomous navigation by programming a mobile robot (TurtleBot3) with a laser range finder (LiDAR). @Prof. ZHANG Hong

This course will cover the following topics:

- ROS1
- Spatial representation
- LiDAR
- Mobile robot kinematics and control
- Robot localization: particle filter, kalman filter, and AMCL
- SLAM with Gmapping
- Path planning: Dijkstra, A*, and DWA


## Lab

Use turtlebot3 and ros1 to verify the theoretical knowledge in the course.

The following repo contains the some lab code:
