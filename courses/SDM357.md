# SDM357 Computer Networking and its Industrial Application

[English](SDM357.md) | [简体中文](SDM357_cn.md)

## Introduction

Computer Networking (Theoretical) + PLC (Practical)

The computer networks theory part is presented in a bottom-up approach, covering the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer in sequence.

The PLC practical part mainly involves programming based on Codesys (which can be quite abstract, and you may encounter numerous environment configuration issues).

## Notes

You can refer to any notes related to computer networks. This course is not very difficult.

For exam preparation, you can directly refer to the course materials.

## Project

Open-topic, as long as it is related to industrial internet, preferably with some engineering practice (in other words, even if you just introduce something, you can still pass :cry:).
