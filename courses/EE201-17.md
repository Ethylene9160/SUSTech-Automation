### Course Recommendation

This is the best comprehensive analog circuit course I have seen: [Hajimiri/New Analog Circuit Design - Caltech](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jf4y117Kr).

This course can help you build a more systematic and comprehensive knowledge system of analog circuits.

Note 1: There is currently no good Chinese translation for this course, so you need to have a certain level of English listening and reading ability.

Note 2: If you just want to score high in the analog circuit exam, there is no need to watch this course. Attending offline classes, doing homework, and reviewing past exam papers will suffice.

Note 3: It’s not that studying the Caltech course won't help you score high, but there are more practical or "efficient" methods. :grinning:
