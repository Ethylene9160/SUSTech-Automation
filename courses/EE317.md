### Extra
Using Kotlin instead of Java is also acceptable in this course.

If you want to develop Android apps in a modern way, you should try **[Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) + [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) + Material**.

For example:
- [squarezhong/Simple-Calculator](https://github.com/squarezhong/Simple-Calculator) (not good examples, just for reference)
- [kafri8889/Calculator-Compose](https://github.com/kafri8889/Calculator-Compose)
- [squarezhong/Musicompose-V2](https://github.com/squarezhong/Musicompose-V2)


## STM32
STM32 standard peripheral library is used in this course.

This part has several assignments but no final project.
